# Discogs Bargain Finder - Project Overview

## Introduction

Discogs Bargain Finder is a web application designed to help vinyl record collectors search the Discogs database for records. Originally intended to find underpriced records on the Discogs marketplace, the project now focuses on providing a powerful search interface for the Discogs database due to API limitations with marketplace access.

## Project Goals

1. **Search the Discogs Database**: Efficiently search for records by artist, album, genre, style, and other criteria
2. **Simplify Record Hunting**: Streamline the process of searching through thousands of releases
3. **Provide User-Friendly Interface**: Offer an intuitive UI with dynamic filtering options
4. **Enhanced Search Experience**: Provide a more powerful search interface than what's available on Discogs
5. **Collection Analysis**: Help users understand the rarity and uniqueness of their collection

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Next.js framework
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management
- **API Integration**: OAuth 1.0a and API key authentication with Discogs API
- **Client-side Storage**: LocalStorage for saving user preferences
- **Deployment**: Vercel (planned)

## Key Features

### Current Features

1. **Discogs Authentication**:
   - OAuth 1.0a integration with Discogs
   - Secure credential management
   - Fallback to API key authentication
   - Robust error handling

   - Dynamic style dropdown based on selected genre
   - Loading indicators and user feedback

3. **API Integration**:
   - Secure connection to Discogs API
   - Authentication with both OAuth tokens and API keys
   - Proper OAuth signature generation for API requests
   - Rate limit handling and retry mechanisms

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Comprehensive search filters (genre, style, format, year, etc.)
   - Database search implementation working around API limitations
   - Results display with links to Discogs
   - Genre-dependent style options for intuitive filtering

5. **Collection Analysis**:
   - Import and analyze user's Discogs collection
   - Calculate rarity scores based on want/have ratios
   - Identify the rarest and most valuable items
   - Visualize collection metrics and statistics

### Planned Features

1. **Advanced Search Features**:
   - Additional filter options
   - Sorting and pagination improvements
   - Quick search presets for common queries

2. **Enhanced Collection Integration**:
   - Full collection import and analysis
   - Collection gap analysis
   - Recommendations based on collection

3. **User Accounts**:
   - User-specific settings and preferences
   - Cross-device synchronization of preferences

## Application Architecture

### Frontend Components

1. **Header**: Navigation and authentication status
2. **SearchFilters**: Form for configuring search parameters with dynamic filtering
3. **ResultsList**: Display of search results from Discogs database
4. **LoginButton**: Handles OAuth authentication flow with direct cookie checking
5. **CollectionAnalysis**: Analyzes user's Discogs collection for rarity metrics

### Backend Services

1. **Authentication Service**: Manages OAuth flow with Discogs
2. **Search Service**: Processes search requests to the Discogs database
3. **Data Service**: Manages data fetching from Discogs API
4. **Collection Service**: Fetches and analyzes user collection data

### API Routes

1. **/api/auth/**: OAuth initialization and callback handling
2. **/api/auth/status**: Authentication status checking
3. **/api/auth/logout**: User logout functionality
4. **/api/discogs/test**: API connectivity testing
5. **/api/search**: Database search endpoint
6. **/api/collection**: Collection fetching and analysis endpoint
7. **/api/genre-style-map**: Dynamic genre-style mapping endpoint
8. **/api/styles**: Retrieve available styles for filtering
9. **/api/genres**: Retrieve available genres for filtering
10. **/api/formats**: Retrieve available formats for filtering

## Data Flow

1. User authenticates with Discogs via OAuth (with API key fallback)
2. User configures search parameters (with dynamic style options based on genre)
3. Application queries Discogs API's database/search endpoint
4. Results are displayed to user with clear formatting
5. User can click through to view releases on Discogs
6. User can analyze their collection by entering their Discogs username

## Security Considerations

1. **OAuth Security**:
   - Tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
   - Secrets never exposed to client-side code
   - Proper OAuth signature generation with URL parameter handling
   - Client-side cookie verification as a fallback

2. **API Credentials Protection**:
   - Consumer secret partially masked in logs
   - Environment variables for production deployment

3. **Rate Limiting Awareness**:
   - Respect for Discogs API rate limits (429 response handling)
   - Authenticated requests to maximize rate limits
   - Automatic retry with backoff for rate limited requests

## Development Roadmap
